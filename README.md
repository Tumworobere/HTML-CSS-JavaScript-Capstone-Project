# My Portfolio

> This is my first capstone project in the Microverse of Module 1 in which I built a GHC Women in computing conference Platform . This is my responsive desktop version and mobile version conference site. The objective was to build a website by sticking with some design criteria. For that I created HTML-CSS-JavaScript-Capstone-Project -repo and cloned into my local machine. For best practices I have implemented Linter,Github Flow and professional documentation as much as I can. 

## Built With

- HTML, CSS, js
- Linters, Markdown
- GitHub Flow
